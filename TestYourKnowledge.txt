1. Describe the problem generics address.
- Generics address the problem of type safety and code reusablilty. In non-generic collecion, it has two key problems: 
	+	Run time errors: Since type checking is deferred until runtime, adding or retrieveing an item of the wrong type can result in runtime exceptions.
	+	Performance Overhead: Casting between different types incurs a performance penalty due to boxing and unboxing for value types.


2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<string> stringList = new List<string>();

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
-	The Dictionary class has two generic type: 
	+ The key: represents the type of keys in the dictionary.
	+ the value: represents the type of values associated with those keys.


4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
this question is a little bit confusing.
If it mean that if a types need to be match with the correct parameters type, it is true.
If it mean that every parameters need to have the same type, it is false.


5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
-	The Add method is used to add items to a List object.

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
Remove: removes the first occurence of a specific object.
RemoveAt: removes at specific index.

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
By including angle brackets <T> after the class name, where T is the type parameter.

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
False. A generic class can have multiple type parameters.

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
True

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
True
